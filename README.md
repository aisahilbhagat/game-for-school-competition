# game-for-school-competition
So i will keep a journal for this game i am designing for the school competition because i dont know if i will make any game after this project because my main interest is in AI/ML so i will keep all the advancements step by step here...

## DAY 1 
So today i basically designed the character which i gave the name "Avant" and gave him the ability to walk in 2 direction which is left and right, jump and attack(I Don't know why i gave this attack because the plan i have now doesnt need any attack thing so but if not needed then i will commentout the logic.)
